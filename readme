This project has been made during my dev training (SEO / accessibility / performance).

My objective was to improve the SEO, accessibility and speed performance of an existing site.

The site in its initial version can be visited here : https://julienjamet-lapanthere-initial-state.netlify.app

Here is the code of this initial version.

The code of the optimized version of the site is available on the main branch.
